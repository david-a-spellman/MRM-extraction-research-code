### MRM-extraction-research-code
#All python scripts and helper files that I wrote while doing research with Dr. Yufei Huang's Lab at UPMC Hillman Cancer Center
* Does not include code borrowed from other sources
* Outside code was adopted from Allen NLP and the DYGIE++ repo
* For the contrastive learning that was attempted the code from the SimCSE was adopted in order to run their supervised configuration with contrastive pairs including hard negatives
* To produce the hard negatives AMR graphs were used that were produced using the AMRLib package with SPACY
* To understand the details of how this code along with the other repos and packages were used the papers produced from this research will be included as PDFs some time soon
* For a quicker overview of the work performed powerpoint files will be included as well
* At a later date the materials used for the presentation at IEEE BHI 2023 will be added after October 18 2023

# Papers
* The first will be a rougher version that was written as the final paper for my MS Project
* This draft is the longest and contains all of the details from the contrastive learning
* Also provides a lot of extra background on the subject area
* The second will be the 4 page paper that was submited to IEEE BHI 2023
* This paper contains the parts of the research that were more refined
* The extended abstract version that was accepted to IEEE BHI 2023 will be included as well
* This shortest 1 page version will be the best to read in order to get a grasp on the research without having to read a lot of detail

# Future work
* As the research continues further updates will be made to this repo with more papers and code
* Currently working on experimenting with using Chat GPT and prompt engineering in order to perform the same MRM extraction
* Will soon be moving onto deploying these models to see what valuable insights can be retrieved when applying this method to a certain area of biomolecular research
